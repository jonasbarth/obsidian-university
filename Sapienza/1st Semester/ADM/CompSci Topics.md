	- **P**olynomial - problems that can be **solved** and **verified** in polynomial time $O(n^c)$ 
	- **N**on-**P**olynomial - problems that can be **verified** in polynomial time, but not **solved**. E.g. Hamiltonian cycle.
	- **NP Complete** - problems that:
		- are in **NP**
		- every problem in **NP** can be reduced to
	- **NP Hard** - problems where solutions **cannot** be **verified** in **polynomial** time. E.g. chess board configurations

- Sorting Algorithmis:
	- Quicksort - pick a random pivot, put smaller items to the left and larger items to right of pivot, recursively.
	- Insertion sort - create a ne
