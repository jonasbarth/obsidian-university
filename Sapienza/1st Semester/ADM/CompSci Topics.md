	- **P**olynomial - problems that can be **solved** and **verified** in polynomial time $O(n^c)$ 
	- **N**on-**P**olynomial - problems that can be **verified** in polynomial time, but not **solved**.
	- **NP Complete** - problems that:
		- are in **NP**
		- every problem in **NP** can be reduced to
	- **NP Hard** - problems where solutions **cannot** be **verified** in **polynomial** time.
