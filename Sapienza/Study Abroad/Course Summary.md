The UPC is a prestigious university in Spain that would challenge me academically and make me a well rounded student. Barcelona is a very interesting city in terms of cultural, social, and political aspects which I would like to explore while there. In addition, I want to brush up my Spanish language skills from high school to really delve into the life there.

Brussels is the heart of Europe and with so many nationalities in the city, there are many opportunities to meet other internationals and exploring the multicultural aspects of the city. The VUB has interesting courses that would complement my study plan here at Sapienza very well and that would for sure be a challenge.

The USI is a smaller university in a smaller town (compared to Sapienza and Rome), which I believe would give a more homey and close feel inside and outside of the classroom. Additionally, I could keep learning Italian while being in Lugano which would be great when coming back to Rome after the Erasmus.
